## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create and manage repositories in GitHub, including adding folders, committing files, and editing markdown documents directly in the browser. 
- GitHub Issues support collaboration by allowing team members to track bugs, assign tasks, and discuss progress.
- Documentation is essential in open-source projects as it helps new contributors understand project goals, workflows, and guidelines.

## Challenges and Solutions
- One challenge I faced was understanding how to properly structure folders within a GitHub repository. I solved this by experimenting with the interface until I became comfortable organizing files.
- Another challenge was learning markdown syntax for formatting text. I overcame this by practicing formatting examples within my README file. 

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills are valuable in my GIS career because they allow me to maintain a professional portfolio of projects. These skills will also enable me to collaborate efficiently with others on data and other work. Understanding version control will also help contribute to open-source GIS projects or managing workflows in a professional environment. 

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
